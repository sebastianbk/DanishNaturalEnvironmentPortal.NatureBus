Jump on the Nature Bus!
=======================

The Nature Bus is a game to explore the sightings of species done by the Danish Natural Environment Portal (DNEP). DNEP collects data gathered by Danish biologists employed by either the local municipalities or the Danish state. The data are exposed to the public through open web services.

When playing the game you can move the Nature Bus around all of Denmark and explore all kinds of species that have been found in the nature. To play the game a gamepad is required. One of the classic (retro) controllers (like the SNES controller) for PC with USB will work.

The game uses the Web Gamepad API written by Ted Mielczarek and others. You can read more about it here: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/12/the-gamepad-api/

Right now only Firefox and Google Chrome implement the Gamepad API. I have only built the game with support for Firefox 29.0 or higher. It can be adapted to work with Chrome too but I haven't done that yet.

Also, the Bing Maps AJAX Control 7.0 ISDK is being used to generate the bird's eye map, which serves as the underlay for the game. You can check that out here: http://www.bingmapsportal.com/isdk/ajaxv7
